# The-FIG-Education-Model

In order for an education model to cultivate geniuses, in my opinion it should primarily aim to facilitate, inspire, and guide as its pillars, as follows:

- **Facilitate** access to the <ins>best quality resources.<ins> (Reading material, audiovisual material, equipment, facilities, etc.)
- **Inspire** students to see the <ins>beauty and utility<ins> in any given subject.
- **Guide** students towards <ins>independent exploration<ins> and support them in that journey.

Through this model one can nurture the two most important qualities of curiosity and self-capacity to learn. As an acronym, I label this model as the FIG model.
